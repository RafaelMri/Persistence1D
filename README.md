Persistence1D is a class for finding local extrema and their persistence 
in one-dimensional data. Local minima and local maxima are extracted, 
paired, and sorted according to their persistence.

The code runs in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of input points.

The package supports C++, Python, and Matlab and comes with extensive documentation and examples.
